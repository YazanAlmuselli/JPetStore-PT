# JPetStore-PT
# 🐾 JPetStore Performance Testing Project

## 🚀 Overview

This repository contains a fully-automated performance testing project for the **JPetStore demo website**, designed and executed using **Apache JMeter**. Every key transaction and user behavior has been simulated, tested, and validated to ensure accurate performance benchmarking and analysis.

---

## ✅ What’s Included

- ✔️ End-to-end **Load Testing**, **Stress Testing**, **Spike Testing**, and **Endurance Testing**
- ✔️ Clean, modular test plan built with JMeter
- ✔️ Scenario optimization to reflect real-world usage
- ✔️ HTML Reports for test visualization and analysis
- ✔️ Verified performance metrics: Response Time, Throughput, Error %, CPU/Memory usage
- ✔️ Integration with **GitHub** for version control and collaboration
- ✔️ **Jenkins CI/CD** integration for automated test execution and continuous performance feedback

---

## 📊 Performance Metrics Monitored

- **Average & Percentile Response Times**
- **Hits Per Second / Requests Per Second**
- **Error Rate**
- **Server CPU / Memory Utilization**
- **Latency Under Load**
- **Concurrent Users vs. Stability**

> 🔍 Each metric was carefully measured under various test loads, and the system behavior was evaluated to detect bottlenecks or scalability issues.

---

## 🎯 Test Scenarios

- 🛒 User browsing categories and products
- 🔍 Product search and filtering
- ➕ Adding items to cart
- 👤 User login and checkout process
- 🧪 Backend API endpoints (where applicable)

Each scenario is structured with appropriate think times, ramp-up durations, thread groups, and realistic test data to mimic actual user behavior.
